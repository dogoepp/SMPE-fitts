```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## Loading libraries

```{r loading ggplot2}
library(ggplot2)
```

## Loading data

```{r loading csv data into a dataframe}
meanMTdf <- read.csv("../data/20211117_1527_MeanMT.csv",header=T)
rawdf <- read.csv("../data/20211117_1527_RawData.csv",header=T)
```

## Plotting the raw data together with the linear regression

```{r Plotting the raw data together with the linear regression}
ggplot(meanMTdf, aes(ID, MT)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method='lm')
```
## Linear modelling

```{r linear modeling}
model <- lm(MT~ID, data=meanMTdf)
summary(model)
```

Weirdly, in contrast to what Fitts' law says, ID does not seem to have an impact on the movement time. 
Also, the R2=0.218 reported by the [experimental software](http://ergo.human.cornell.edu/FittsLaw/FittsLaw.html) and the R2=0.008146 I find here, are different.
